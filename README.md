# Amazon-DynamoDB-pricing-and-security

A quick breakdown of Amazon DynamoDB pricing and security concepts.

## Overview

I thought that since the DynamoDB users are only increasing as time goes by I would create this repository to help newer users breakdown pricing and security concepts into more basic and staright-forward terms. This quick breakdown will be divided into two parts, starting with cost optimization and slowly getting into security concepts. By the end of this you should be able to quickly assess your needs and limits as it pertains to your DynamoDB database.
